# Introduction
Foundation models (FMs) are leading a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, especially ChatGPT in natural language processing and Stable Diffusion in computer vision [(Gupta, Tarun, et al. 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06665). Nevertheless, they have achieved less promising results in the tabular domain, though tabular data are one of the most common modalities in both industries and sciences. A long-term vision for foundation models in the tabular domain is to develop FMs with better understanding, reasoning, and analysing tabular data which require a higher-level intelligence.
